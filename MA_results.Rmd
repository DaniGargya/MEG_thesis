# Results

## Sustainability competencies as sustainability attitudes and sustainability behaviours (TPB-based) (Research Question 1)

Contrary to my prediction, I found that one year after the ESD intervention, sustainability attitudes and sustainability behaviours did not increase for either the involved or the control group (Figure 2) across the 206 surveys. I found no statistical differences between time points within any group (see Appendix D for statistical results).  In line with my predictions, I found that the involved group (n=7) reported (some) statistically higher sustainability attitudes and behaviours (cumulative SA/SB and SB) than the control group one year after the intervention (see Figure 2 and Table X for statistical outputs). The involved group reported higher mean scores than the control group for all sustainability competencies at all measurement points. Pre-intervention and one year post-intervention, the reported behaviour, intention and cumulative TPB scores differed significantly between the groups. Surprisingly, for the involved group, all reported sustainability competencies peaked immediately post-intervention (MP2) but decreased again one year after the intervention (MP3).

## Sustainability attitudes/ sustainability behaviours (TPB-based) and efficacy beliefs (Research Question 2)

  I found a strong positive relationship between the scales of sustainability attitudes and sustainability behaviours operationalised with the theory of planned behaviour and the scales operationalised with the construct of efficacy beliefs (r (47) = .79, p < .001, Figure 3, see Table X for statistical results).

## Sustainability competencies as efficacy beliefs (Research Question 3)

### Personal and collective efficacy beliefs

Contrary to my predictions, I found no statistical differences between personal and collective efficacy beliefs within and between the involved and control groups (Figure 4) among the 49 students surveyed at measurement point 3. The reported mean scores of the involved group were higher than those of the control group for both collective and personal efficacy beliefs. Overall, I did not find any statistical differences and the means were all very close to each other.

### Aim- and action-focussed efficacy beliefs
In line with my predictions, I found that the involved group reported significantly higher scores for aim-focus than the control group (W = 8, p < .05, Figure 5, see Table X for statistical results) at measurement point 3. Although the involved group also scored higher on the action-focus, there were no statistical differences (W = 1, p > .05). I found no differences between the action and aim scores for the involved group (W = 1, p > .05) or the control group (W = 1, p > .05).

```{r RQ3b, echo=F, fig.cap="\\label{fig:fig1} The aim-focused aspect of efficacy beliefs was significantly higher for the involved group than the control group across the XX students surveyed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test at measurement point 3.
